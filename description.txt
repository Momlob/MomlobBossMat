Have you ever fought a Boss, only for it to give you some Item you didnt want?
Farmed out a Boss and got mad, that it gave you the same crappy Item 10 times in a Row?
Or are just tired of having to refight Bosses for that needed Weapon altogether?
Well, this Mod aims to fix that. Lucky you!

Crafty Boss Drops replaces Boss Drops with a Boss unique Material.
This Material can then be used to craft the Bosses usual random Drops.

If you want to keep the random Drops from Bosses, enable Drops in Config.
